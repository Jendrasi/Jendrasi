My name is Matthew Jendrasiak.

Professionally, I am primarily a software developer. Though I've worked or played in digital media (photography, filmmaking, game design), wood working, gardening, cooking, brewing, and yoga. From working in front of a screen in my living room, to helping fix a machine at the MakerSpace, to practicing at an ashram in India, there's nothing so satisfying as solving a problem and making things better.

This is a space where I share any personal code I'm allowed to share, that I'm not entirely embarrassed of.

### I am open to full or hybrid remote work in IT, from QA to Dev to DB Admin to Data Science.

## About Me:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few things in order of priority:
  - ATM, primarily job hunting and getting certifications/practicing.
  - Improving my Kombucha, which I sell to family and friends until the product and process are perfect and I can feasibly (and legally) scale without cutting into a full time job. I'm designing a website to manage reservations. Will share the repo here when coding starts.
  - Flo Studios, a media brand about mindful and sustainable daily practices anyone can take on to improve their quality of life.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to maintain laser cutters, as well as taking a MongoDB certification course.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on "Beyond Skyrim". I haven't applied because I have a lot on my plate and I don't play video games anymore. But I used to want to be a game developer and seeing their work brings out my inner child.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with JOB HUNTING.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my time away from work. I've taken a long break and it was very enlightening.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email me at matt (dot) jendrasiak (at) gmail (dot) com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Almost everyone in Charlotte's Yoga community or at the MakerSpace calls me Titus. It's my preferred nickname away from family, but I go by Matt at work for simplicity.
